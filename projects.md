## 🛡️ Security Monitoring Lab (Wazuh SIEM)

**Goal:**  
Simulate SOC-style monitoring and alert investigation for endpoint security events.

**Environment:**

- Windows 10/11 VM (endpoint)
- Wazuh Manager & Agent

**What I Did:**
- Deployed Wazuh and onboarded Windows endpoints
- Collected and analyzed Windows security logs
- Investigated authentication failures and suspicious activity
- Tuned alerts to reduce noise and false positives
- Documented findings and remediation steps

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- SIEM concepts
- Log analysis
- Incident triage
- Root cause analysis
- Documentation

**Next Improvements:**
- Alert enrichment
- Custom detection rules
- Integration with additional endpoints
