# Hi, I’m Chirag 👋

I’m an IT Support Specialist with 5+ years of experience supporting enterprise users, infrastructure, and data center environments. I’m currently transitioning into cybersecurity, focusing on security operations, monitoring, and incident investigation.

Alongside my professional work, I maintain a home lab where I practice real-world security scenarios such as log analysis, alert triage, and endpoint monitoring using SIEM tools.

🔐 Areas of focus:
- Security monitoring & alert investigation
- Endpoint & log analysis (Windows)
- SIEM tooling and detection logic
- Automation with PowerShell
- Learning SOC workflows and incident response
